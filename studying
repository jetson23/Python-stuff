BGP 

	path vector protocol - maintains path info, updated dynamically; similar to distance vector, except 1 "speaker node" per domain
	EGP protocol; only one
	
	
EGP - used for connecting ASs

IGP - Interior Gateway protocol; used for within ASs (OSPF most common, also RIP)

	distance vector - uses "hop count" as the metric
			e.g. - RIP, RIPv2, 
	
	link state vector - determines route based on cost (multiple factors, distance, speed, bandwidth, delay, load)	
			e.g. - OSPF
	
routing metrics:
	hop count - how many other routers to go thru
	MTU - 
	cost - reliabilty, round trip	
	latency - amount of delay on link

BGP Hijacking:
	deliberate or accidental, several ways:
	- AS announces that it originates a prefix that it does not acutally originate
	- AS announces a more specific prefix than what may be announted by the true originating AS
	- AS announces that it can route traffic to hijacked AS thru a shorter route than is already available(regardless of if route exists)
